  <h2 style="text-align:center;"><font size="13"> Want to Gain Parental Respect? </h2>

    <center><p id="rcorners2"><font color="#8a8363"><font size="6"> The best ways to gain your parents' respect is to mostly do as they expect from you. If they expect you to do well in school, do your best to get those good grades, study, or maybe even tutor.
      Do your parents expect you to help around the house? Easy, maybe wash the dishes after dinner, walk the dog, clean up your room, etc. Any little thing helps. Show them you are capable of responsibility.
      Show them a skill or ability of yours. Overall you are their child. They love and respect you whether you know it or not. Deep down they respect you very much. Always remember that.<br>
