      <h2> Bruuh, do I have an insane lyfe story. So like I ordered a book shelf from Ikea
and it'd be delivered in the next few day. Okay like I'm in my room, right? Delivery truck would be there in a while
and I'm just chillin' and then I just suddenly hear
"PEWHUAUBSEROSIJEASEHRA" like all my power goes out! I'm not even joking
All my power goes out and I'm like, "Oh yeah?"
So I was thinking about it for a while and I thought maybe the power just went out but
then I'm like, "No I think something happened..."
and I was like, "My IKEA bookshelf should like, BE HERE by
now." (The guy said he was gonna be here in 10 minutes)
so I go off to my balcony and I look over
and there's a giant truck crashed into my building!
I just was like, and I was like,
"Huh..." and I call the IKEA guy and I'm like,
"Did you just crash into my building and cut off my power?"
and he's like "Oh, it wasn't me, it was my brother!" I'm DEAD!! <br>

      <h2> And as I sat there brooding on the old, unknown world, I thought of Gatsby’s wonder when he first picked out the green light on the end of Daisy’s dock. He had come a long way to this blue lawn, and his dream must have seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it. He did not know that it was already behind him, somewhere back in that vast obscurity beyond the city, where the dark fields of the republic rolled on under the night.

Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that’s no matter – to-morrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther… And one fine morning –

So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.<br>
Man I love this book! <br>
