        The best ways to gain your parents' respect is to mostly do as they expect from you. If they expect you to do well in school, do your best to get those good grades, study, or maybe even tutor.
          Do your parents expect you to help around the house? Easy, maybe wash the dishes after dinner, walk the dog, clean up your room, etc. Any little thing helps. Show them you are capable of responsibility.</h2>

  YOU'RE BEING CHASED BY AN ANIMAL! AAAH! BUT DON'T PANIC!
  <br>
  Firstly remain clam! Now depending on the animal you have a few options.
    One option would be play dead. Limit your breathing, remain perfectly still and seemingly lifeless. Another option would be make yourself appear bigger,
    outstretch your arms, stand on tiptoes, ext. This is make you seem like a bigger animal thus making the animal give up the chase....
