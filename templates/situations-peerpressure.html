<h2 style="text-align:center;"><font size="13"> Oh dear. Getting peer pressured into something you don't want to do? Here's some help; </h2>

  <center><p id="rcorners2"><font color="#8a8363"><font size="6"> When someone is asking or wanting you to do something that you don't want to do can be very stressful and may bring bad consequences.
However, you are strong and can be bigger than to allow others to get you to do what they want. You are your own person and should follow what YOU want to do.
Some tips to help getting out of that situation would be making an excuse to get out of there. Or even simply saying no. <br>
